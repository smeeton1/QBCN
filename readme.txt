QBCN (Qbit Controlled Networks) is a prgram for simulating a qubit being used to control path on a network. The system is made up of a quantum walker that moves along the graph structure and a qubit at each node. The quantum walker interacts with the qbit as it passes through the node. The qubits are then measured to see if the walkers is at the node. If the walker is at the node then the path connected to the node are changed.
